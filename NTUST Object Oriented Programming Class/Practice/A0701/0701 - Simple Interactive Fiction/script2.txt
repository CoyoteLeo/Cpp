Hello world!
-I'm a boy. #7:30
-I'm an ant. #0.0

#0.0
No, I'm a human!
-I'm a boy. #7:30
-I'm an ant. #0.0

#7:30
Opening my eyes, I am looking at the clock on the wall.
-It's 7:30. #E1
-It's 8:00. #7:35-1
-It's 13:00. #7:35-2

#E1
7:30 is a late, but I still rushed into my classroom safely.
Nothing happened.
It's a wonderful day.

#7:35-1
It seems I'm late.
-Hurry up. #E2
-Have breakfast first. #E3

#E2
On the way to school, I bumped into a cute girl.
Also I noticed that I misread the time.
It's a miracle.
What a lucky day!

#E3
I was scolded by the teacher.
It's a terrible day.

#7:35-2
What the h*ll, I'm late for school!
-Hurry up. #7:45
-Well, a day off doesn't matters... #E4

#E4
I decided to stay at home.
It's a peaceful day.

#7:45
Hurry up for school.
Suddenly, a sense comes up to me.
My second sight tells me something will occur.
-Just an illusion. #E5
-Dodge to the left. #HE
-Dodge to the right. #7:46

#E5
Suddenly a car rushes out from my right hand side.
The last memory is that,
there's something,
fly off my body.
...

#HE
I remember everything.
My gift, the lost ability.
I can see through the future!
I'll name this day my awakening day.

#7:46
Suddenly a car rushes out from my right hand side.
There's something fly off my body.
An unclear sound appears somewhere.
???: Return to this morning?
-Return. #0
-No. #E6

#E6
Can't see anything.
I'm dead.
