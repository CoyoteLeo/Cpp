Opening my eyes, I am looking at the clock on the wall.

What the h*ll, I'm late for school!

Hurry up for school.
Suddenly, a sense comes up to me.

(2) Dodge to the left.
(3) Dodge to the right.
Suddenly a car rushes out from my right hand side.
There's something fly off my body.
An unclear sound appears somewhere.
???: Return to this morning?
(1) Return.
