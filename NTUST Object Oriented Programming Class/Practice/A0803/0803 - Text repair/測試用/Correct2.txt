Luckily, the wisest little pig had been watching the scene from the window of his own brick house, 
and he rapidly opened the door to his fleeing brothers. And not a moment too soon, for the wolf 
was already hammering furiously on the door. This time, the wolf had grave doubts. He blew once, 
he blew again and then a third time, but all was in vain. The three little pigs watched him and 
their fear began to fade.
