luckily, the wisest little pig had been watching the scene from the window of his own brick HOUSE, 
AND he rapidly opened the door to his fleeing brothers. aND not a moment too soon, for the WOLF 
WAS already hammering furiously on the door. this time, the wolf had grave doubts. he blew ONCE, 
HE blew again and then a third time, but all was in vain. the three little pigs watched him AND 
THEIR fear began to fade.
