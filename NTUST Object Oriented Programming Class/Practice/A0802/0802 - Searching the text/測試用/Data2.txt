The series centers on Link, the playable character and chief protagonist. 
Link is often given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda and the kingdom 
of Hyrule from Ganon, who is the principal antagonist of the series; 
however, other settings and antagonists have appeared in several games. 
The plots commonly involve a relic known as the Triforce, a set of three 
omnipotent golden triangles. The protagonist in each game is usually not 
the same incarnation of Link, but a few exceptions exist.
